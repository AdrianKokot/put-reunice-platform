# REUNICE Platform

## Docker

### Run the application, rebuilding all images from source code
`docker-compose up -d --build`

### Run the application using already built images
`docker-compose up -d`

### Stop the application, but leave Docker Volumes intact
`docker-compose down`

### Configure the application
Please read the instructions in the `.env` file (located in the main project directory) and adjust all configuration variables in that file. When first deploying the application using `docker-compose`, the variable `DATABASE_SCHEMA_HANDLING_ON_STARTUP` should be set to `create`. Once deployed, the value should be changed to `validate` or `update`. Details can be found in the comments available in `.env` file.
