# REUNICE Platform

## Docker

### Run the application, rebuilding all images from source code
`docker compose up -d --build`

### Run the application using already built images
`docker compose up -d`

### Stop the application, but leave Docker Volumes intact
`docker compose down`

### Run only the backend service in container, frontend locally
```bash
docker compose up -d backend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Running services

| URL | Service | Container |
| --- | --- | --- |
| localhost:8080 | spring-boot | backend |
| localhost:80 | nginx | frontend |
| localhost:8025 | mailpit ui | mailpit |
| localhost:1025 | mailpit smtp server | mailpit |
| localhost:5432 | postgres | postgres |
| localhost:8108 | typesense | typesense |

### Configure the application
Please read the instructions in the `.env.example` file (located in the main project directory). Copy the file and name it `.env`. Adjust all configuration variables in that file. When first deploying the application using `docker-compose`, the variable `DATABASE_SCHEMA_HANDLING_ON_STARTUP` should be set to `create`. Once deployed, the value should be changed to `validate` or `update`. Details can be found in the comments available in `.env.example` file.
